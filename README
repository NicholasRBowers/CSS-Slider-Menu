Objective: To create a CSS-only layout including a scrollable menu that slides out from the left. Meant for mobile versions of sites.

Live Demo:  http://woodysenterprises.com/other/Navbar3.html

Additional Information:
-CSS-only
-Meant for mobile devices
-Akin to Facebook's Mobile and App layout
-Completely breaks in IE
-Collaboration welcome!

Operation Logic:
-Uses the checkbox-hack to store state information (http://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/)
=When unchecked, menu is closed, when checked menu is open.
-Input checkbox exists at the base level of the HTML (under <body>) with an absolutely positioned <div> tag afterwards that encapsulates the page.
-<div> tag holds the rest of the page, including fixed absolutely positioned elements.
-Header and Navigation toggle are fixed at top, scrollable <div> under, and fixed/scrollable menu to the left.
-An extra invisible label allows a click anywhere on the right to toggle states and collapse the menu.

Comments:
-Completely broken in IE, but as this is meant for mobile only, I'm not sure that's a problem.
-Zooming out on a mobile device sometimes causes rendering problems.
-Had to put the rest of the page in a <div> that was a sibling to the <input> element, because the default Android browser only supports the adjacent sibling combinator (+) when used in tandem with a pseudo-class (:checked). NOTE: It does support the sibling combinator (~), but it only picks up the adjacent element.
